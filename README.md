## Project purpose

Purpose of the project was to create a space where engineer can put their 'dirty notes', share them accross the group and then transform to article while also being able to create articles. It is using 'like' system, it is able to handle comments, adding articles to favorites and tagging articles. It also have a filtering system which allows to search for specific group of articles by its tags and then search through articles inside of this group. I used react query as a cache, redux for handling notes on client-side and infinite scroll for pagination. On backend i used a bit of Macine Learning to compare articles while approving them using cousine similarity algorithm. As a frontend i decided to use ReactJS and as a backend fastAPI and postgresql as a database. Project is still in development stage.
